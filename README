Overview
========

The UserVoice iPhone SDK is distributed as a static library, along with several
resource files. In order to embed the UserVoice functionality into your own
iPhone app, you need to perform the following steps:

1. Copy the SDK into your project
2. Update a few build settings
3. Add the UserVoice resources
4. Register your iPhone app on the UserVoice website
5. Download the customized plist file and add it to your project
6. Add a single line of code where you want to invoke the UserVoice functionality

The instructions below describe this process in more detail.


Instructions
============

Copy the SDK into your project
------------------------------
* Unzip the UserVoice iPhone SDK.
* Copy the contained UserVoice folder into your project.

  *Note: Technically you can copy this folder wherever you want, inside or outside
         of your project directory. The instructions below assume that the UserVoice
         folder is located within the root of your project folder, so you may need to
         adjust the various paths accordingly.*


Update Build Settings
---------------------

*Note: We will describe how to change the necessary settings on the target level. Most of these settings can be specified either at the target or the project level.*

* Double-click on the app target.
* Click on the General tab.
* Add QuartzCore.framework, SystemConfiguration.framework, and libxml2.dylib.
* Click on the Build tab.
* Make sure that the Configuration drop-down shows "All Configurations"
* Look for Additional SDKs
* Double-click, then add "`UserVoice/SDK/$(PLATFORM_NAME)$(IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET).sdk`"
* Look for Header Search Paths
* Double-click, then add "`UserVoice/SDK/$(PLATFORM_NAME)$(IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET).sdk/usr/local/include`"
* Look for Other Linker Flags
* Double-click, then add "`-lUserVoice -ObjC -all_load`"

Add Resources
-------------

* Right-click on Resources, then choose Add -> Existing Files.
* Select the "`UserVoice/Resources/UserVoice`" folder. In the dialog, leave "Copy items..." unchecked but make sure "Recursively create groups..." is selected. Then click Add.


Download and add plist
----------------------

* Download your custom `UserVoice.plist` file from the UserVoice website.
* Copy it into the root of your project directory.
* Right-click on Resources, then choose Add -> Existing Files.
* Select "`UserVoice.plist`". Leave "Copy items..." unchecked. Click Add.

Invoke UserVoice View
---------------------

* Add the following import statement to the class that is responsible for launching the UserVoice view (probably a view controller):

  `#import <UserVoice/UserVoice.h>`
* In your view controller, where you want to invoke the UserVoice view (probably from a button action), use the following code:

  `[UserVoice presentUserVoiceModalViewControllerForParent:self];`
